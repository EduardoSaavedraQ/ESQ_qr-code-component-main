## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first challenge from Frontend Mentor; however, it wasn't my first approach to html and css.

I've worked with these two languages in some other college projects but I hadn't studied them carefuly becuase of the hurry to deliever the assignments and, despite what I stated above, this was the first time I applied the Mobile-first workflow and used css media queries.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 376px) {
    .container {
        width: 350px;
        height: 530px;
        padding: 15px 15px;
    }

    img {
        margin-top: auto;
        width: 100%;
    }

    p {
        margin: 0 9%;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep practicing Responsive designing. I'm a little obsesive and I don't feel completely sitisfied until my work looks great on every device. For example, the following are examples of devices where the QR looks very small because of the dimensions of the devices:

![IPad Pro Screenshot](./images/screenshots/IPad%20Pro.png)

And look what happen if I change to a landscape view on an IPhone SE:

### Useful resources

- [w3schools HTML tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [w3schools CSS tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)

The two resources above helped me to begin on this.

- [How to Order CSS Properties](https://www.example.com) - I looked for this because I wanted to know if there was some kind of standar to follow.
